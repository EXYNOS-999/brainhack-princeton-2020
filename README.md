Brainhack Princeton 2019 is a satellite event for [Brainhack Global 2019](http://www.brainhack.org/global2019/) taking place November 13th–15th at Princeton University. Brainhack is 3-day intensely collaborative hackathon focused on best practices in open neuroscience, including community, infrastructure, and software development. Brainhacks are a great opportunity to discover new tools, push the boundaries of open science, and meet collaborators building tomorrow's neuroscience. Our goal is to create a space where anyone can learn and contribute, even if this is your first hackathon. Meals and refreshments will be provided for registered participants.

### When and where
9am–6pm, November 13th–15th, 2019  
A-Level Study Area, Princeton Neuroscience Institute  
Princeton University

### Code of conduct
All hackathon participants are expected to follow the [Brainhack Global Code of Conduct](http://www.brainhack.org/code-of-conduct.html) at all times during the event.
